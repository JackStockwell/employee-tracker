# employee-tracker
Track your employees across your business!

Challenges - Struggled with retrieving employees and having the manager's name appear in the table, this was solved by creating an alias of the employees then joining the alias to the original and referencing that way. 

## Credits

[Stack overflow on creating table alias](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3263935/multiple-alias-names-for-a-table) - Used to create an alias of employee table to join it to itself.
